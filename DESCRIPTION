Description: Estimating causal effects in the presence of spillovers is of great interest in statistics.
    This package provides tools for instrumental variables estimation of causal parameters under network interference of unknown form.
    The target parameters are the local average direct effect, the local average indirect effect, the local average overall effect, and the local average spillover effect.
    The methods are developed by Hoshino and Yanagi (2023)<doi:10.48550/arXiv.2108.07455>.
